**Serializable**

Serializable is a standard Java interface. You can just implement Serializable interface and add override methods.The problem with this approach is that reflection is used and it is a slow process. This method create a lot of temporary objects and cause quite a bit of garbage collection. Serializable interface is easier to implement.

**Parcelable**

Parcelable process is much faster than serializable. One of the reasons for this is that we are being explicit about the serialization process instead of using reflection to infer it. It also stands to reason that the code has been heavily optimized for this purpose.

**Conclusion**

1. Parcelable is faster than serializable interface
2. Parcelable interface takes more time for implemetation compared to serializable interface
3. serializable interface is easier to implement
4. serializable interface create a lot of temporary objects and cause quite a bit of garbage collection
5. Parcelable array can be pass via Intent in android
